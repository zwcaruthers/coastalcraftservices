            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Coastal Craft Services! My name is [Your Name], and I've always had a deep love for the sea and boating. Growing up near the coast, I spent most of my time on the water, learning everything about boats, from their maintenance to the joy of a well-detailed craft. This passion inspired me to create a service that brings the same level of care and attention to every boat we work on.
            </p>
            <p>
                After spending years working on boats for friends and family, I decided to turn my passion into a full-time business. Coastal Craft Services was born out of a desire to help boat owners maintain their vessels in pristine condition, allowing them to focus on enjoying their time on the water without worrying about the upkeep. Our detailing and service solutions are designed to meet the unique needs of each boat owner.
            </p>

From routine cleaning and polishing to more in-depth maintenance, we take pride in delivering the highest level of quality. My team and I are dedicated to ensuring your boat looks its best, whether it's for your personal enjoyment or preparing for a special event.
            </p>
            <p>
